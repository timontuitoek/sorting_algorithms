Sorting algorithms are fundamental techniques in computer science and mathematics used to rearrange elements in a specific order or sequence. The primary goal of sorting is to organize data so that it can be easily searched, retrieved, and analyzed.


Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm that places an unsorted element at its suitable place in each iteration.
